# SDSL - Succinct Data Structure Library (vgteam fork)

## This fork

This is [vgteam's](https://github.com/vgteam) fork of the Succinct Data Structure Library (SDSL).
As [SDSL 2](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite) is no longer maintained, vgteam tools and libraries will depend on this until SDSL 3 is released.

## Major changes

- [x] Switch to C++14.
- [x] `sd_vector` improvements: iterator over set bits and support for predecessor/successor queries.
- [x] `rle_vector`: a run-length encoded bitvector.
